# logchange — FAQ

## Why doesn’t my changelog include recent commits?
Ensure you’ve added entries with `logchange add` or that your configuration includes the desired sources.

## How do I customize the changelog format?
See [Reference](reference.md) for configuration options.

## Can I generate notes for a specific range?
Yes, use flags such as `--since-tag`, `--until-tag`, or date ranges (if supported).
